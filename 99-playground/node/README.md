# Node Playground

Make sure to use Node v23 which has experimental support for TypeScript:

```
node --watch --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning demo.ts
```



Alternatively you can use Deno or Node:

```
deno --watch demo.ts
```

```
bun --watch demo.ts
```



The commands are also in corresponding scripts in `package.json`.
